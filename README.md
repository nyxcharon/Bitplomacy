Biplomacy
=========

This is our Senior Design project for EE/CS/CPE 481.  It is a slightly different version of the game "Diplomacy".  
For the engine we use Erebos - an open source project that uses openGL with C based wrappers so that java developement
is simple and easy to use.  For questions about the game engine please contact [emails/URL to come].

Intended for use on a Ubuntu server and for developement in eclipse on a Linux OS.  Please note that this current
build will not work for developement on Windows and Mac environments.
